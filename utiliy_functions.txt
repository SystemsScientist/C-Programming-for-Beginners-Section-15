Section 15: Utility Functions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Utility Functions I

	- to use these routines, include the header file <stdlib.h>

	- int abs(n)

		+ returns the absolute value of its int argument n

	- void exit(n)

		+ terminates program execution, closing any open
		  files and returning the exit status specified by
		  its int argument n

		+ EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE defined in <stdlib.h>

		+ other related routines in the library that you
		  might want to refer to are abort and atexit

	- char *getenv(s)

		+ returns a pointer to the value of the environment
		  variable pointed to by s, or a null pointer if the
		  variable doesn't exist

		+ used to get environment variables


Utility Functions II

	- void qsort(arr, n, size, comp_fn)

		+ sorts the data array pointed to by the void pointer
		  arr

		+ there are n elements in the array, each size bytes
		  in length

		+ n and size are of type size_t

		+ the fourth argument is of type "pointer to function
		  that returns int and that takes two void pointers
		  as arguments"

		+ qsort calls this function whenever it needs to compare
		  two elements in the array, passing it pointers to the
		  elements to compare

	- int rand(void)

		+ returns a random number in the range [0, RAND_MAX],
		  where RAND_MAX is defined in <stdlib.h> and has a 
		  maximum value of 32767

	- void srand(seed)

		+ seeds the random number generator to the unsigned int
		  value seed

	- int system(s)

		+ gives the command contained in the character array
		  pointed to by s to the system for execution,
		  returning a system-defined value

		+ system("mkdir/usr/tmp/data");


Assert Library

	- the assert library, supported by the assert.h header file,
	  is a small one designed to help with debugging programs

	- it consists of a macro named assert()

		+ it takes as its argument an integer expression

		+ if the expression evaluates as false (non-zero),
		  macro writes an error message to the standard
		  error stream (stderr) and calls the abort()
		  function, which terminates the program

	- for example,

		z = x * x - y * y; // should be + *
		asserts(z >= 0); // asserts that z is greater than
				 // or equal to 0


Other Useful Header Files

	- time.h

		+ defines macros and functions supporting operations
		  with dates and times

	- errno.h

		+ defines macros for the reporting of errors

	- locale.h

		+ defines functiosn and macros to assist with
		  formatting data such as monetary units for different
		  countries

	- signal.h
	
		+ defines facilities for dealing with conditions that
		  arise during program execution, including error
		  conditions

	- stdarg.h
	
		+ defines facilities that enable a variable number of
		  arguments to be passed to a function
